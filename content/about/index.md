## Hi! I am Abel

I was born in Spain and I am double graduated in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Granada, Spain. At this moment I am looking for a job where I can grow professionally with the starting point of the bachelors.

In addition, I am studying a master to go deeper in the field of software engineering, I am specially interested in back end engineering, where I approach problems using the abstraction given by the mathematics.

In my free time, I like practicing sports like Judo, in which I have a black belt and jumping rope. I also like to read graphic novels in french, a language I am eager to learn.

For my future, I am looking for a job where I can grow professionally and personally, that's the reason why I learn on my own technologies and techniques like git, node or Go. If you want to know more about me, you can reach me out via email in _abeljsanchez20@gmail.com_
